                         <dt class="main-text main-text-small">I’ve commonly seen people in their 20s, including myself, come across this chasm of working for money but not for enjoyment. It’s an important prioritization to start off with as you have to pay the bills - but it’s also a means to an inflated lifestyle that may not be necessary.
                            <br></br>
                            Once you can afford rent, food, & good health - my own opinion is that its important to take a look at what you enjoy doing. Work is going to be about 80% of your adult life, so best take into account what that work consists of.
                            <br></br>
                            There are many people who do work loads & feel drained all the time. There are also those who work loads but love what they do. I feel that burnout might just come from doing something that you hate doing. After all, working hours and hours on something you love is actually quite energizing.
<br></br>
So how do you figure out what work you love doing?
<br></br>
In my own life, i’ve been trying to find out the perfect framework to understand the answer to this. How does one go about deciding what to put their time & energy into career wise? In my example, I own a marketing agency and make decent money servicing clients - but my true passion is in programming & technology. Its the thing I would do regardless if I got paid because I love to build things (just built my own tweet scheduler bot, see here for example).
<br></br>
The importance of answering this question is related to how successful you will become in life.
<br></br>
In any career or skillset, there is a starting point as a beginner where you are filled with excitement and energy. As you gain more experience, you slowly start to lose that enthusiasm as things start to get much harder. The job gets more tedious, the company starts facing setbacks, the advanced level of knowledge you are starting to learn gets more complex. This area of difficulty is well documented & is referred to by author Seth Godin as “The Dip”.
<br></br>
In this dip is where all the fruits come to bear - you’ll truly find out if this was something you love doing because 2-4 years into this thing you’ll have to face the reality of doing things you don’t love. In my own example, marketing started out as a huge curiosity and a way to make money. In the beginning, both of those truths kept me going. Now during year 3, I feel the heavy burden of the dip. I get exactly what Seth means, and I can understand how most companies that fail only fail because they weren’t in it with the right intentions to get through this period. The same can be said for someone in their career path.
<br></br>
The entrepreneurs that start companies out of passion for their idea (not money) are the ones that can surpass this dip and succeed. Phil Knight went bankrupt with Nike 9 times before any success. Brian Chesky & Joe Gebbia maxed out on credit cards 7 times and failed to get funding for Airbnb on 3 separate occasions. Multiple times, they were laughed out of board rooms as VCs complained that strangers would never let each other into their homes. But they kept pushing forward - for the love of the idea.
<br></br>
Asking yourself the simple question of “What would I want to be doing 10 years from now even if I haven’t seen a lot of success?” is a way of revealing the hidden truth of the thing you actually love to do ( & should probably focus more time on).
<br></br>
There may be a lot of baggage when you start to see the real answer to this question - you might have to take a pay cut, move somewhere, drop the ego, begin from scratch…
<br></br>
But what i’ve found from researching a lot of the most successful people in life is that they weren’t afraid to go through this process of starting over in order to commit to what they truly love doing.
<br></br>
I’ve also found that a lot of them also had this realization around the age of 26 to 31. A period which most would consider “late in life”.
<br></br>
Either way, in 10 years time they’d still be happily tinkering a way at a craft that they love.
<br></br>
It was particularly interesting to also find out that most of these individuals actually turned out to be financially successful regardless.
<br></br>
But aside from money, status, fulfillment, etc - there may be the simple question you have of “How in the world can I get paid to do this quirky thing that I enjoy?” Maybe you’re into collecting birds, creating origami, or reupholstering old vehicles.
<br></br>
Well, our world will only start to become more accessible via technology as the years go by. All this means is that more people will be able to reach more people.
<br></br>
More access means more visibility for that weird thing you love doing. You can broadcast it, teach it, write it, film it, draw it, talk about it, interview on it, build products for it, etc.
<br></br>
And because there are so many more people you can reach, all you need is a sliver of attention to monetize your love.
<br></br>
Overall, I don’t think the world has always been a place where you can double down on what you love and actually have a chance of making it your career. Back in the day - it was all about getting a job that just paid the bills.
<br></br>
That actually makes this conversation more intriguing to me. If we finally live in a day & age where doing what you love is an actually an option - shouldn’t we pursue that more?
<br></br>
The odds of you existing in a time period where this choice is actually doable is way less than 1%.
<br></br>
Yet here you are.
<br></br>
Building your unique career requires that you follow your unique curiosities. All that hard work you’ve been putting in that wears you down can finally transmute into a craft that gives you energy & lights you with fire. If you let it.
<br></br>
Everybody has got something that they love doing regardless of if they’ll make money from it. They watch videos on it for fun, they read books on it to learn more, and their curiosity seems insatiable.
<br></br>
It might be worth addressing this as it can lead you down a beautiful life path of getting paid to work on something you love doing.
<br></br>
We all know that plans never really work out. Life is unpredictable. But whatever twist & turns it may throw at you - at least you’ll still be enjoying the privilege of working on that thing you love every single day.
<br></br>
In the end, it isn’t really how hard you row the boat but which direction you row the boat in.
